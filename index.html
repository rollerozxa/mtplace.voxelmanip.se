	<h1>mtPlace</h1>

	<p>mtPlace was a canvas 512x512 pixels in size, and with 24 colours at your disposal.</p>

	<p>Inspired by the Reddit r/place social experiments that took place during 2017 and 2022, mtPlace was a collaborative canvas hosted as a Minetest server. You painted the canvas by placing nodes on it within Minetest, and it would show up on the map that updated every 5 minutes.</p>

	<p>The server was shut down on 2023-06-11 after running for approximately four months. Below is the final screenshot that was taken before its shutdown. A timelapse of the canvas is coming soon.</p>
